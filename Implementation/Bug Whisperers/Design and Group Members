Architectural Design: (Scaffolding for the entire solution)
  * Console Application via Visual Studio framework


High Level Design: (System/Application design and APIs)
  * Out of Scope 


Mid Level Design: (Subsystem and services design)
  * modules needed: 
     * UserInput ( takes in two numbers from console ) 
     * Normalizer ( normalizes numbers to integers )
     * DigitRootSum ( takes in a number 
     * Add ( adds two numbers, outputs sum/number)
     * Main ( Runs all programs, contains startup program information to be printed to console. )
* The UserInput is run so that Add has two numbers to sum and then Add’s output is routed to DigitRootSum


Detailed Design: (Class/Method design)
User Input:
* readValue: prompts user for a number, reads line, returns raw string
* getValues: calls readValue twice, validates input is only numbers and allowed characters, returns both raw stringA and stringB

Normalizer:
* normalizeToDigits: trims whitespace, handles optional leading +/-, removes decimal point if present, rejects illegal characters, returns digit-only strings in variables num1 and num2

Add: sums num1 and num2 and returns numSum
* need to discuss best data type, maybe long

DigitRootSum:
* Base case: if n < 10, return int n
* numSum will then be % by 10 to give the LCD by itself
* LCD will be added to remainingNum( numSum / 10) giving the variable DigitSum
* DigitRootSum will then be called again with DigitSum as the input.
* end condition is when n is a single digit, satisfying the base case


 Main:
* Will print startup information and handle running of other methods
