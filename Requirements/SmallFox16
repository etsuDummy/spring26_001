//WakeySnakey Game
//
// I approached this as if I was going to take this to a design phase, spoiler alert, I am. I am going to take this game through every stage of the sdlc, as we learn about them through class. since we jsut learned about design. I am going to model the game this week, and show you, and then take it to every other step, as we go.
// Tried my best to follow SMART criteria
// made these requirements by: first, I manually made the first 28. then I gave the list to AI and asked it where my blindspots were (simulating proofreading, or having a coworker look at my work) it had some good suggestions and I wrote the remainder of the requirements from those.

── General / Platform ──

1. The solution is a single player game. -- MANDATORY
2. The solution just begins the game on run. -- MANDATORY
3. The solution must be a console app. -- MANDATORY
4. The solution must be written in C#. -- MANDATORY
5. There is no pause feature. The game runs continuously from wake-up until win or loss. -- MANDATORY
── Window & Grid ── 

6. Snake game must have a hard set window size, 640×480. -- OPTIONAL 
7. The grid is tile-based. Cell size is 20×20 pixels, giving a 32×24 grid (768 total cells) at the 640×480 window size. -- MANDATORY
8. The grid boundary IS the window edge. There is no separately drawn border/wall graphic. The window itself is the boundary, and its size is locked by the program so it cannot be resized. -- MANDATORY

── Snake Spawning & Structure ── 

9. The snake spawns in the bottom right corner of the grid, facing up. -- MANDATORY 
10. The snake's initial length is 5 tiles. -- MANDATORY 
11. The snake body is stored as an ordered list of cell coordinates. Each tick, the new head position is prepended; if no growth, the tail is removed. -- MANDATORY 
12. Snake body follows exact path of snake head. -- MANDATORY

── Snake Movement & Speed ── 

13. The snake moves continuously at a "current" tick rate. Movement is automatic and constant; the snake does not wait for input to advance. -- MANDATORY 
14. The starting tick rate is slow and beginner-friendly: approximately 5 ticks per second (200ms per tick). Speed increases gradually — every 30 cells of growth, the tick interval decreases by 10ms. Minimum tick interval floor is 80ms (12.5 ticks/sec). -- MANDATORY 
15. The snake gets gradually faster as it grows longer. Speed increase must have a floor (minimum tick interval) so the game remains playable. -- MANDATORY

── Input Handling ── 

16. The solution uses the arrow keys to move (relative to the player and the screen, not relative to the snake's perceived POV). -- MANDATORY 
17. Pressing the arrow key opposite to the snake's current direction (e.g., Down while moving Up) is silently ignored. The snake must not be able to reverse directly into itself. -- MANDATORY 
18. The game buffers at most 1 pending direction change between ticks. If multiple keys are pressed between ticks, only the first valid one is kept. -- MANDATORY 
19. The solution must handle non-arrow-key keystrokes by doing nothing. -- MANDATORY

── Food ── 

20. Food spawns at a random unoccupied cell (not on the snake, not on other food). Random selection must be uniformly distributed across all eligible cells. -- MANDATORY 
21. Exactly 2 food items are on the grid at all times. When one is eaten, a replacement spawns immediately. Exception: if only 1 empty cell remains, only 1 food exists. -- MANDATORY 
22. The initial 2 food items spawn when gameplay begins (after wake-up if wake-up is implemented, otherwise on run). -- MANDATORY

── Growth & Eating ── 

23. The snake grows a finite set amount each time the snake contacts (eats) food on the screen. -- MANDATORY 
24. The snake grows by exactly 1 tile per food eaten. -- MANDATORY 25. Growth is applied on the same tick the food is eaten (tail does not retract that tick). -- MANDATORY 
26. Snake body growth always happens at the rear-most part of the snake. -- MANDATORY

── Collision & Boundaries ── 

27. Collision detection (self and wall) is checked AFTER the snake moves each tick. -- MANDATORY 
28. Game loses and exits if the snake's head enters a cell currently occupied by any body segment. -- MANDATORY 
29. Game loses and exits if the snake's head moves outside the grid boundary (hits a wall). The snake does NOT wrap around screen edges. -- MANDATORY

── Win / Loss / Scoring ── 

30. Game wins if snake eats 20 "food". -- MANDATORY 
31. The solution must be winnable. -- MANDATORY 
32. On game win, show a victory screen then exit. -- OPTIONAL 
33. On game loss, show loss screen then exit. -- OPTIONAL 
34. The score is displayed on the win/loss screen before the application exits. -- OPTIONAL 
35. Win and loss screens wait for any keypress before the application exits. -- OPTIONAL 
36. The score is 100 for each "food" eaten, and 50 for each second survived. -- OPTIONAL 
37. The application exits with return code 0 on both win and loss. -- OPTIONAL

── Visual / Rendering ── 

38. The solution uses this color pattern: snake = green, background = dark grey, food = yellow. -- OPTIONAL 
39. The snake head has a distinct sprite/visual that differentiates it from the body segments. Body segments are plain green tiles; the head has a unique appearance (e.g., eyes, different shade, directional indicator). -- OPTIONAL 
40. The terminal cursor must be hidden during gameplay. -- OPTIONAL 
41. Only changed cells are redrawn each tick (dirty-cell rendering). The entire grid is NOT re-rendered every frame. -- MANDATORY 
42. Console character representation: body segments = solid block character (█), food = a distinct character (e.g., ● or ◆), empty cells = space. Head rendering should approximate a rounded, wider shape using appropriate characters or character combinations. -- OPTIONAL

── Wake-Up Sequence (Optional Feature Set) ── 

43. The solution contains a snake, which begins asleep. -- OPTIONAL 
44. Snake wakes up when the player clicks it. -- OPTIONAL 
45. On wake up, snake shakes a little, then begins moving forward, beginning the game. -- OPTIONAL 
46. The wake-up click (requirement 44) must land on one of the snake's occupied cells to trigger. Clicks elsewhere are ignored. -- OPTIONAL 
47. Mouse input is only used for the wake-up click (requirement 44). During gameplay, mouse input is ignored entirely. -- OPTIONAL
